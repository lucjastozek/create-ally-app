# create-ally-app

This is a CLI tool built to help you spin up new projects super quickly using the Ally template. No more copy-pasting and manual setup - just one command and you're ready to code!

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get going:

```bash
npx create-ally-app my-awesome-project
```

That's it! The tool will walk you through the rest âœ¨

## Accessibility Features

This template comes with a full suite of accessibility (a11y) features to ensure your application meets WCAG standards and provides an inclusive user experience. It includes:

- **Scripts for accessibility testing** using [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) and [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci), integrated with GitHub Actions
- **Static accessibility checks** via the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` ESLint plugin
- **Example code** demonstrating accessible components, end-to-end accessibility testing, and color palettes with WCAG-compliant contrast ratios for both light and dark modes
